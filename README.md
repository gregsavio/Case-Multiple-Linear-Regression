# Case-Multiple-Linear-Regression

In machine learning, regression is a method used for predictive modeling, where algorithms are used to predict continuous outcomes. Multiple linear regression, also called multiple regression, is a statistical technique that forecasts the result of a response variable by using several explanatory variables together. This method is an extension of linear regression, which uses only one explanatory variable.
